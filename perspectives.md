# Perspectives on Chronic Lyme Disease

Welcome down the rabbit-hole.

"Chronic Lyme Disease" is a poorly defined term and there are unfortunately different perspectives on it. Many doctors are resistant to the idea of chronic Lyme Disease, because 

## Perspective #1: Chronic Lyme Disease is a dangerous hoax

This is a very common viewpoint and it's worth acknowledging this one up front.

See for example A Critical Appraisal of â€œChronic Lyme Disease [Feder et. al. 2007](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra072023). [Other websites](https://lymescience.org/) are keen to dismiss the idea that chronic Lyme disease is a real illness,
and seek to "help" patients by telling them their symptoms are all in their heads.

## Perspective #2: Chronic Lyme disease is Post-Treatment Lyme Disease Syndrome (PTLDS)

## Perspective #3: Chronic Lyme disease is Multi-System Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS)
